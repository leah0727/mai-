- Designed an AI model to predict gene expression profiles from H&E-stained histopathological images by leveraging the relationship between tissue morphology and gene expression data.
- Evaluated multiple architectures (ResNet-50, SENet, ViT, EfficientNet, Inception-ResNet-V2) using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, achieving a top score of 0.5105 with Inception-ResNet-V2 by optimizing learning rate and batch size with Optuna.
- Enhanced performance to 0.5175 by modifying the regression layer (SiLU + Dropout + Linear) and fine-tuning the learning rate, with the highest score achieved at epoch 10.
- Skills: Python, Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Networks, ViT, PyTorch, Image Processing, Pearson Correlation Coefficient, Hyperparameter Tuning (Optuna), Model Evaluation, Regression modeling
